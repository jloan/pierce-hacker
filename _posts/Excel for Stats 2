## Abstract
Excel is an important tool, with numerous functions available to help with math, data, and statistics. At Pierce, it is not just the STEM students who use stats in their major, but also business and education. One of the tasks students taking statistics are often given (and sometimes struggle with) is finding the 7-point summary of a large set of data. This tutorial can help with the process, using Excel to compute the 7-point summary.

## Lesson Objectives/Outcomes
