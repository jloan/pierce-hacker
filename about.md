# Origins

PierceHacker began (and continues) as a project in a Technical Writing Course first taught at Pierce College in Fall 2018. The project is modeled after [ProfHacker](https://profhacker.com/) and [The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) and further inspired by work in ["Open Pedagogy"](http://openpedagogy.org/open-pedagogy/) and the desire to move away from the ["disposable assignment."](https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2975)
